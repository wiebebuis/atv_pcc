The Embodied Mind: Cognitive science and human experience.

Titel van een boek over cognitiewetenschappen en de menselijke ervaring, geschreven door Varela, Thompson & Rosch (1991, 2016).

"This book begins and ends with the conviction that the new sciences of mind need to enlarge their horizon to encompass both lived human experience and the possibilities for transformation inherent in human experience. Ordinary, everyday experience, on the other hand, must enlarge its horizon to benefit from the insights and analyses that are distinctly wrought by the sciences of mind. It is this possibility for circulation between the sciences of mind (cognitive science) and human experience that we explore in this book."
